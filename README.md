# 30539-ComputerScienceModule1
This repository contains a python assignment for the class 'Computer Science Module 1'. It consistes in the implementation of a DTree class, which represents a tree data structure. 
The DTree class provides several methods for manipulating and querying the tree:
1. a depth method
2. attach_tree 
3. internal _find method. This method should take some data as argument and return a node that contains that data, if 
present. 
4. the in operator, lets a user write x in t where t is a DTree and get a bool answer detecting if any of the nodes has x as its data . 
5. cut_subtree whose purpose is to find a node with the given data and cut it out of the tree.
